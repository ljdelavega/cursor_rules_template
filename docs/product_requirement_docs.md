## 1. Overview
[Provide a high-level overview of your product here. Explain what problem it solves, who it's for, and why it's valuable. This section should be a concise summary that anyone can understand, from developers to stakeholders.]

---

## 2. Core Features
[List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:]

### Feature 1: [Feature Name]
* **Description:** [What it does.]
* **Value:** [Why it's important to the user and the product.]
* **High-Level Functionality:** [How it works at a high level, from the user's perspective.]

---

## 3. User Experience
[Describe the user journey and experience.]

### User Personas
* **[Persona Name 1]:** [Brief description of the target user, their goals, and their pain points.]
* **[Persona Name 2]:** [Brief description of another target user, their goals, and their pain points.]

### Key User Flows
* **[Flow 1 - e.g., User Registration]:** [Step-by-step description or a simple diagram of how a user accomplishes a specific task.]
* **[Flow 2 - e.g., Creating an Item]:** [Step-by-step description or a simple diagram of another core user task.]

### UI/UX Considerations
* [General principles for the user interface and experience, e.g., "The design should be clean, intuitive, and responsive." Mention any key accessibility considerations.]

---

## 4. Technical Architecture
[Outline the technical implementation details.]

### System Components
* **Frontend:** [e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular]
* **Backend:** [e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django, Ruby on Rails]
* **Database:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL]
* **Authentication:** [e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0]

### Data Models
* **[Model 1 - e.g., User]:** `id`, `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `created_at`
* **[Model 2 - e.g., Post]:** `id`, `user_id`, `title`, `content`, `created_at`

### APIs and Integrations
* **Internal API:** [Brief description of the primary API endpoints.]
* **External Integrations:** [e.g., Stripe for payments, Twilio for SMS notifications.]

### Infrastructure Requirements
* **Hosting:** [e.g., Vercel, AWS, Google Cloud]
* **CI/CD:** [e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI]

---

## 5. Development Roadmap
[Break down the development process into phases. Focus on the scope of what needs to be built in each phase.]

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Requirements
* [List the absolute essential features required for the first launchable version of the product.]
* **Feature A:** [Description]
* **Feature B:** [Description]

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
* [List features and improvements planned for future releases.]
* **Phase 2:** [e.g., User profiles, settings page]
* **Phase 3:** [e.g., Admin dashboard, analytics]

---

## 6. Logical Dependency Chain
[Define the logical order of development to get to a usable state as quickly as possible.]

1.  **Foundation:**
    * [Setup basic project structure, database schema, and authentication.]
    * [Build the core API endpoints for the foundational models.]
2.  **Core Usable Feature:**
    * [Develop the frontend and backend for the single most important feature to make the product interactive and visible.]
3.  **Building Out from the Core:**
    * [Sequentially add the remaining MVP features, ensuring each can be built upon the existing foundation.]

---

## 7. Risks and Mitigations
[Identify potential risks and how they'll be addressed.]

### Technical Challenges
* **Risk:** [e.g., Integrating with a complex third-party API.]
* **Mitigation:** [e.g., Create a proof-of-concept early on; have a backup API in mind.]

### MVP Scope Creep
* **Risk:** [The tendency to add "one more thing" to the MVP, delaying launch.]
* **Mitigation:** [Strictly adhere to the defined MVP requirements; move all non-essential ideas to the "Future Enhancements" section.]

### Resource Constraints
* **Risk:** [e.g., Limited time or budget for a personal project.]
* **Mitigation:** [Focus on a very lean MVP; leverage open-source libraries and cloud services with generous free tiers.]

## 8. Appendix
[Include any additional information that supports the PRD.]

* **Research Findings:** [Links to market research, competitor analysis, etc.]
* **Technical Specifications:** [Detailed technical docs, API contracts, etc.]
* **Design Mockups:** [Links to Figma, Sketch, or other design files.]
