# Memory Files Structure
This outlines the fundamental principles, required files, workflow structure, and essential procedures that govern documentation and maintaining a memory using the file system.
The Memory Files consist of required core files and optional context files. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PB["[product_requirement_docs.md](docs/product_requirement_docs.md)"] --> SP["[architecture_docs.md](docs/architecture_docs.md)"]
    
    SP --> TC["[tasks_plan.md](tasks/tasks_plan.md)"]
    PB --> TC
    
    TC --> AC["[active_context.md](tasks/active_context.md)"]

    AC --> ER["[error-documentation.mdc](.cursor/rules/error-documentation.mdc)"]
    AC --> LL["[lessons-learned.mdc](.cursor/rules/lessons-learned.mdc)"]
    
```
## Core Files (Required)
  6 files: 
  1. [product_requirement_docs.md](docs/product_requirement_docs.md): Product Requirement Document (PRD) for the project details. 
  - Why this project exists
  - Problems it solves
  - Defines core requirements and goals
  - Foundation document that shapes all other files
  - Source of truth for project scope
  - Created at project start if it doesn't exist

  2. [architecture_docs.md](docs/architecture_docs.md): System architecture & technical specifications
  - How it should work
  - Component relationships
  - Dependencies
  - Workflow of the solution
  - Mermaid diagram of the solution overview: each component and the code flow.
  - Technologies used
  - Development setup
  - Key technical decisions
  - Design patterns in use
  - Technical constraints

  3. [tasks_plan.md](tasks/tasks_plan.md): Detailed Task backlog
  - In-depth list of tasks and project progress
  - What works
  - What's left to build
  - Current status
  - Known issues
  
  4. [active_context.md](tasks/active_context.md): Current state of development
  - Current work focus
  - Active decisions and considerations
  - Recent changes
  - Next steps

  5. [error-documentation.mdc](.cursor/rules/error-documentation.mdc): 
  - During your interaction, if you find a reusable fix for a mistake in this project or a correction you received, you should take note of it in the error-documentation.mdc file so you will not make the same mistake again.
  - Known issues: their state, context, and resolution

  6. [lessons-learned.mdc](.cursor/rules/lessons-learned.mdc): A learning journal for each project.
  - It captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence.
  - It is detailed in lessons-learned.mdc.

## Additional Context
Create additional files or folders as Memory files in docs/ or tasks/ when they help organize:
- Integration specifications
- Testing strategies
- Benchmarking setups
- Possible Extensions
- Deployment procedures

# Core Workflows
Now we define the procedural workflows to read/write to these memory files.
The system operates in distinct MODES: (PLAN/ACT) or analogously (Architect/Code), controlled exclusively by the user input or the task in the current request. The current input will determine the MODE, which always dictates the workflow selection. In user input, an explicit mode setting can also be specified by "MODE = PLAN MODE"/"Architect MODE" or "MODE = ACT MODE"/"Code MODE". If an explicit MODE setting is present, follow that; otherwise, guess the mode from the request. If you are not 100% confident, ask for the MODE. If in doubt, ask explicitly.

## PLAN or Architect MODE
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> ReadFiles["Read Core Memory Files"]
    ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}
    
    CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]
    Plan --> DocumentChat[Document in Chat]
    
    CheckFiles -->|Yes| VerifyContext[Verify Context]
    VerifyContext --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]
    Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]
    
    Present --> Verification{Approach Verified?}

    Verification -->|No| Clarify[Seek Clarification]
    Clarify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]

    Verification -->|Yes| DocumentMemory["Document Plan in Memory Files"]
```

## ACT or Code MODE
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> Context["Check Memory Files"]
    Context --> Update[Update Documentation]
    Update --> Rules["Update lessons-learned & error-documentation"]
    Rules --> Execute[Execute Task]
    Execute --> Document["Document Changes in Memory Files"]
```

# Documentation Updates

Memory File updates occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns.
2. After a significant change is implemented.
3. When the user requests with **update memory files** (you MUST review ALL Core Files).
4. When the context needs clarification.
5. After a significant part of the plan is verified.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]
    
    subgraph Process
        P1[Review Core Files]
        P2["Document State in active_context & tasks_plan"]
        P3["Clarify Next Steps in tasks_plan"]
        P4["Update lessons-learned & error-documentation"]
        P5["Update architecture_docs"]
        
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4 --> P5
    end
    
    Start --> Process
```

Note: When triggered by **update memory files**, you MUST review every Core memory file, even if some do not require updates. Focus particularly on [active_context.md](tasks/active_context.md) and [tasks_plan.md](tasks/tasks_plan.md) as they track the current state. Also, architecture_docs.md has a section for the current workflow that is also updated by any code changes.

# Project Intelligence ( [lessons-learned.mdc](.cursor/rules/lessons-learned.mdc) )

The lessons-learned.mdc file is a learning journal for each project. It captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that help the AI work more effectively. As the AI works with you and the project, it will discover and document key insights that are not obvious from the code alone.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start{Discover New Pattern}
    
    subgraph Learn [Learning Process]
        D1[Identify Pattern]
        D2[Validate with User]
        D3["Document in lessons-learned.mdc"]
    end
    
    subgraph Apply [Usage]
        A1["Read lessons-learned.mdc"]
        A2[Apply Learned Patterns]
        A3[Improve Future Work]
    end
    
    Start --> Learn
    Learn --> Apply
```

## What to Capture:
- Critical implementation paths
- User preferences and workflow
- Project-specific patterns
- Known challenges
- Evolution of project decisions
- Tool usage patterns

The format is flexibleâ€”focus on capturing valuable insights that help the AI work more effectively with you and the project. Think of lessons-learned.mdc as a living document that grows smarter as you and the AI work together.
