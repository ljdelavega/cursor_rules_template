  File: docs/architecture_docs.md @architecture_docs.md
  Required parsing:

  2. Extract and understand:
     - Module boundaries and relationships
     - Data flow patterns
     - System interfaces
     - Component dependencies
  3. Validate any changes against architectural constraints.
  4. Ensure new code maintains the defined separation of concerns.
  
  Error handling:
  1. If the file is not found, STOP and notify the user.
  2. If an architectural violation is detected, WARN the user.
